* The Subordination Sophistication Analyzer (SSA) 1.0 measures subordination sophistication of English texts in addition to coordination complexity. 
<br>
<br>

* The 9 indices computed by this tool are:  
    (1) proportion of main clauses (= number of main clauses per clause), <br>
    (2) proportion of finite adverbial clauses (= number of finite adverbial clauses per clause), <br>
    (3) proportion of nonfinite adverbial clauses (= number of nonfinite adverbial clauses per clause),  <br>
    (4) proportion of finite complement clauses (= number of finite complement clauses per clause), <br> 
    (5) proportion of nonfinite complement clauses (= number of nonfinite complement clauses per clause), <br>
    (6) proportion of finite relative clauses (= number of finite relative clauses per clause), <br>
    (7) proportion of nonfinite relative clauses (= number of nonfinite relative clauses per clause),  <br>
    (8) proportion of finite coordinate clauses (= number of finite coordinate clauses per clause), <br>
    (9) proportion of nonfinite coordinate clauses (= number of nonfinite coordinate clauses per clause).  <br>
