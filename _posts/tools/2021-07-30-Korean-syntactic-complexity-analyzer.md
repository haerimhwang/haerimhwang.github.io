* The Korean Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (KOSCA) measures syntactic complexity of Korean texts. 
<br>
<br>

* The seven indices computed by this tool are: <br>
(1) number of sentences, <br>
(2) number of morphemes per sentence, <br>
(3) number of coordinate clauses per sentence, <br>
(4) number of relative clauses per sentence, <br>
(5) number of subordinate conjunctive endings per sentence, <br>
(6) number of verbs per sentence, and <br>
(7) type frequency of particles per sentence. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

* This tool has been developed using [KoNLPy](https://konlpy.org/en/latest/){:target="_blank"} and [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home){:target="_blank"}.
