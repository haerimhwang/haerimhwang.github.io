* This script is for extracting f0 values from multiple sound files.  
<br>
<br>

* Codes
  
    * Set your directories
        
          form Analyze pitich of sound files 
            comment Directory of sound files
            text sound_directory /Users/Haerim/Desktop/2017Fall/LING632/Praat_script/wav/
            sentence Sound_file_extension .wav
            comment Directory of pitch files
            text pitch_directory /Users/Haerim/Desktop/2017Fall/LING632/Praat_script/pitch/
            comment Full path of the resulting text file:
            text resultfile /Users/Haerim/Desktop/2017Fall/LING632/Praat_script/wav/results.txt
          endform
          
    <br>
    
    * Check if the result file exists
        
          if fileReadable (resultfile$)
            pause The result file 'resultfile$' already exists! Do you want to overwrite it?
            filedelete "'resultfile$'"
          endif
               
    <br>
            
    * Write a row with column titles to the result file
    <br>
    
    * Remember to edit this if you add or change the analyses!)

    * Make a list of all the sound files in the directory we’re using, and put the number of filenames into the variable “number\_of\_files”

          number_files = Get number of strings
          
    <br>
    
    * Set up a “for” loop that will iterate once for every file in the list
    <br>
    
    * Create the complete pitch contour (i.e., you select the Sound and choose To Pitch…)
